THIS IS NOT A COMPLETED TEMPLATE (yet). It's just to give people an idea how Firebase/Firestore works. It is in no way efficient or DRY yet (planning to fix soon).


This is a template from FS-APP-TEMPLATE, but made to use FIREBASE/FIRESTORE instead of API routes and a local database. The old api routes/database files have been left in (because I don't feel like taking them out).

This still has some nasty looking code, as i haven't had time to clean it up or comment it. It'll get better when i fix it.


READ BELOW BEFORE USING:

The firebase config needs to be unique to you. The docs explain how to do this easily, but this is a good turorial "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zdvmgGsww0". 

All the database stuff also is unique to you, so you'll have to rewrite that to fit your needs. 

I will add comments to explain this in the files, but for now just edit the config and any db stuff.
